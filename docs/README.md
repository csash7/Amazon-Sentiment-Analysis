## ***Dataset Description -***
The Amazon's Books Dataset containing a million books, thier reviews and their ratings.


## ***Our Apporaches -***
Approach 1 : Using spaCy for tokenization, Lemmatization and Removing Stopwords and using scikit-learn to build our models for different batches of data and using Ensemble Techqniques to create an aggregate prediction result.

Approach 2 : Using NLTK for tokenization, Lemmatization and Removing Stopwords and using scikit-learn to build our models for different batches of data.

Approach 3 :  Working with Pyspark to handle our Big Data.
