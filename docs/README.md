## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a text analysis method that detects polarity (e.g. a positive or negative opinion) within text, whether a whole document, paragraph, sentence, or clause.

Understanding people’s emotions is essential for businesses since customers are able to express their thoughts and feelings more openly than ever before. By automatically analyzing customer feedback, from survey responses to social media conversations, brands are able to listen attentively to their customers, and tailor products and services to meet their needs.

In this project we carry out Sentimental Analysis on Amazon's Books Dataset based on reviews on a million books and predict whether this review is 'Positive', 'Neutral', 'Negative'. We have four different approaches to our project.

## Our Data
The Amazon's Books Dataset containing a million books, thier reviews and their ratings.

## Our Approaches 
Approach 1: Using spaCy for tokenization, Lemmatization and Removing stopwords and using scikit-learn to build our models for different batches of data and using Ensemble Techniques to create an aggregate prediction result.

Approach 2: Using NLTK for tokenization, Lemmatization and Removing Stop words and using scikit-learn to build our models for different batches of data.

Approach 3: Using a custom-built Naïve Bayes model

Approach 4: Handling Big Data
